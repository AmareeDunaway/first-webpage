       My name is Amaree and I am 16 years old. I go to Simon Technology High School and is #2 in my class. I plan to be a dermatologist in the future and I actually mentally prepared myself as much as possible at the fact I'll be in school for about 12 years. But does that really matter? Anyways, I have a dog and two horses and they're pretty awesome. My parents are pretty awesome too, I don't give them enough credit as they should get. Love yall. I got two sisters and two brothers making me the baby of the family while they are 30+. I am in love with Jeep Wranglers. I've studied them for two years+ and became fasinated on the things that can do and how you can mod it to whatever you want. The picture of me isn't my Jeep but I did want it but instead I'll look forward to a stock Jeep and build from there. Going back to dermatology, 9/10 I'm always looking at your skin to see if it's clear or not. I will always analyze just because it's pretty cool. I know that sounds weird but hey, we're all weird in our own way. On a serious note, dermatology is cool to me because you bring a new sense of confidence in people's life. They instantly change and feel beautiful again and let something go of theirs that has bothered them.
